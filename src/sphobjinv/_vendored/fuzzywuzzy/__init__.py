r"""``sphobjinv._vendored.fuzzywuzzy`` *package definition module*.

``sphobjinv`` is a toolkit for manipulation and inspection of
Sphinx |objects.inv| files.

This subpackage vendors an archival version of fuzzywuzzy from
before it incorporated python-Levenshtein and thus acquired
the GPL licence by flow-through, overriding the prior
MIT license of the package.

All code in this subpackage vendored from:
https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy/tree/4bf28161f7005f3aa9d4d931455ac55126918df7

Imports and code details were changed as required to make the code compatible
with current (2021) versions of Python 3.

Link to MIT-licensed fuzzywuzzy version obtained from the bottom of the README at:
