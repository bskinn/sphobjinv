# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

`sphobjinv` development currently does not use any maintenance branches,
so any security fixes will be released inline with the primary development
branch.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please use the
[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).
Tidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure, including
any updates on progress toward a fix on a vulnerability and
on accept/decline status of the vulnerability report.
